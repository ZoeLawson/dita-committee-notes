 <title>The core of DITA: Topic and map</title>
 <shortdesc><!--The focus of DITA shifted between DITA 1.1 and DITA 1.2 in a way that was not recognized by many users. -->The
  DITA Technical Committee wants to emphasize that topic and map are the base document types in the
  architecture.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Because DITA was originally developed within IBM as a solution for technical documentation,
   early information about DITA stressed the importance of the concept, task, and reference
   topics.</p>
  <p rev="review-1">Many regarded the topic document type as nothing more than a specialization base
   for concept, task, and reference.</p>
  <p>While this perspective might still be valid for technical <ph rev="review-1">content</ph>,
   times have changed. DITA now is used in many other contexts<ph rev="review-1">, and people
    developing content for these other contexts need new specializations. For example, nurses who
    develop evidence-based care sheets might need a topic specialization that has sections for
    evidence, impact on current practices, and bibliographic references.</ph></p>
  <!--<p>The DITA Technical Committee recognized this during the development of DITA 1.2. The structure of the DITA 1.2 specification and the organization of the XML grammar files reflected a division of the specification into three groupings: Base, technical content, and learning and training. Unfortunately, time and resource limitations as well as OASIS requirements prevented the DITA Technical Committee from distributing the DITA 1.2 release in three editions.</p>-->
  <p>The structure of the three editions makes it very clear that topic and map are the base
   document types, and that the other document types are specializations designed for specific user
   communities â€“ <ph rev="review-1">currently</ph> technical <ph rev="review-1">content</ph> and
   learning and training.</p>
